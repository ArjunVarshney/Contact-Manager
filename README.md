# Contact Manager App

In this Project I have made a basic contact manager app that can save, delete, edit contacts. I just wanted to practice making a react app and explore different things that can be done with it.

## Frameworks used

In the project, I have use the following technologies or frameworks or npm packages:-

 - React
 - React-Router
 - Nanoid
 - Axios
 - Json-server

## How to start the Application

 - Run `npm start` in server-api directory to start the rest api on `http://localhost:3006/contacts`. 
 - Run `npm start` in contact-app directory to start the react application on `http://localhost:3000/`
